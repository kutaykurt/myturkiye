          "Anatolia, one of the most significant regions in the ancient world, began to show evidence of advanced human activity during the Neolithic era. Çatalhöyük, a major settlement from around 7000-6200 BC, is among the most notable archaeological sites from this period. Çatalhöyük's extensive size, elaborate mural art, and advanced urban planning reflect an early sophistication in social and cultural organization. The inhabitants of Çatalhöyük were primarily engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry, marking a critical shift from nomadic to settled life. This transition laid the groundwork for future complex societies in Anatolia, influencing neighboring regions through trade and cultural exchange.",
